        "Lucky Lo, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Lo Ersare's alt-pop pseudonym, is like a game bucket. She jumps between the familiar and the quirky; the groovy and the unexpected. And like the play's multicolored panes of chalk, Lo uncovers new land and subjects of both light and dark shades, while the honest, heartfelt and sincere vocals always shine through frivolity. Lo is originally from Sweden, but moved to Copenhagen in 2014 as a street musician, who frequently visited the canals at Christianshavn with her instrument, the banjo.",

        "Nordkraft Big Band plays tonight music by Clare Fischer (1928-2012), who was one of the most original and respected American organizers up through the 50-60-70s. His arrangements can be heard on releases with such diverse artists as Prince, Michael Jackson, Dizzy Gillespie, Donald Byrd and Paul McCartney. As a pianist, he was a significant inspiration for, for example, Herbie Hancock and he received 11 Grammy nominations over time. His piano playing and arrangements stand as a milestone of quality and very special originality in the American musical tradition and of organizers around the world as a completely unique artist in a class of its own.",
